# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# RTU Detection App

A web application for detecting and analyzing Roof Top Units (RTUs) using Google Maps integration and AI-powered detection.

## Features

- Interactive Google Maps integration
- RTU detection using AI models
- Location tracking and management
- Lead score calculation
- GeoJSON data integration
- Marker-based location visualization

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- Google Maps API Key
- Environment variables configuration

## Project Structure

```
rtu-detection-app/
├── backend/           # FastAPI backend server
├── frontend/          # React frontend application
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
```

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Initialize database:
```bash
python -m app.init_db
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Running the Application

### Development

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Production

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Start the backend in production mode:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend directories with the following variables:

### Backend
```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Frontend
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement proper authentication for production
- Regular security audits and updates

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
